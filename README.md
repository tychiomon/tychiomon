Hi there, I'm Tychiomon. 

Currently a second year comp sci student. I've got loads of ideas for programs and apps and am trying to realize them. 
I'm currently learning the MERN stack and C++.

There's lots for me to learn and I still have to grow a lot but I believe the best way to learn is through hands on practice.

Things I like:
- Digimon
- Rock Climbing
- Animation
- Spending too much time on the internet
