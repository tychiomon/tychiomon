Hi there, I'm Tychiomon. 

Currently a second year comp sci student. I've got loads of ideas for programs and apps and am trying to realize them. 
I'm currently learning the MERN stack and C++.

I still think there's lots for me to learn as I grow but I believe the best way to learn is through hands on practice.
